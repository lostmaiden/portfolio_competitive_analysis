<td>1. Imaginaria Creative</b>
<br>(<a href="http://imaginariacreative.com" target="new">imaginariacreative.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/16/12</td>

<td>
<i>Warm, Friendly, Americana</i> -- use of inviting, casual language ('hi there' and 'socialable folks), along with images of produce and steak ('classic' 'timeless' 'fertile fields'), and a child in cowboy hat advertising "western family festival fun".
</td>

<td>Large headers, clear font, and selectively bolded text work well to effectively convey information about the design company.</td>

<td>The front page automatically (or manually) shuffles between 3 banners. Portfolio uses a filterable gallery/grid, and individual images can be enlarged and viewed with slideshow-esque scrolling.</td>

<td>Navigation consists of five straight-forward links along the upper right. Large headers on the top of each page serves as an easy indicator for where you are. There are also links to their work along the very bottom of the site.</td>
</tr>


<td>2. Sahar Design
<br>(<a href="http://www.sahardesign.com" target="new">sahardesign.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/17/12</td>

<td><i>Bold, Direct, Approachable</i> -- Blue-Orange contrast makes for an aesthetically pleasing layout with subtle, yet bold statements ("friendly & accessible"). Details on the hover-over links give a more casual and approachable feeling to the otherwise professional site.</td>

<td>The site is relatively small, and the navigation bar is clear along the top of the page. For the purposes of the site, the information is presented in a straight-forward and effective manner.</td>

<td>Portfolio contains six pieces which can be scrolled through via arrows on the left and right. Smooth transition between the pages on the portfolio pages. The site's design has low interactivity, but it is sufficient for the purposes of the site.</td>

<td>Simple and effective, the navigation bar is uncluttered and hover-overs give a more casual explanation on each link. Titles and highlights in the navigation bar allow for easy identification of which page you are currently on.</td>
</tr>


<td>3. Tomer Hanuka
<br>(<a href="http://thanuka.com" target="new">thanuka.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/17/12</td>

<td><i>Minimalistic, Clean, Bold, Thematic</i> -- overall site is plain, but the minimalistic style better highlights the bold and thematic artwork featured on the site.</td>

<td>Home page features the artist's newest artwork, while the rest are hidden away in little dots (links) on the left-side navigation. Though unlabeled, guess-work is eliminated by thumbnail previews when hovering over individual dots.</td>

<td>Aside from thumbnail previews when hovering over the portfolio links, there is minimum interactivity on this site.</td>

<td>Navigation are links on the left-side. Clearly labeled text makes navigation very straight-forward. It is also possible to navigate chronologically through individual artworks.</td>
</tr>


<td>4. Diego Latorre
<br>(<a href="http://diegolatorre.com" target="new">diegolatorre.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/17/12</td>

<td><i>Grungy, Down-to-Earth, Rough, Artistic</i> -- design details and textures used throughout the site give it a grungy and artistic feel. Cup of coffee and other office supplies in a organized clutter give the site a relatable, human-like personality.</td>

<td>Site is orgranized as a single page with four anchors accessible by the links on the navigation on the left. Each section is clearly labeled. Portfolio section contains thumbnails and arrows to scroll through them.</td>

<td>Clicking on the navigational links on the left jumps (with animation) to the anchored section on the page. Portfolio thumbnails open up enlarged in a lightbox, which you can scroll through.</td>

<td>Navigation is very self-explanatory. You can also scroll down the page to view all the sections of the site if the navigation is ignored.</td>
</tr>


<td>5. Emotions
<br>(<a href="http://www.emotionslive.co.uk" target="new">emotionslive.co.uk</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/17/12</td>

<td><i>Vibrant, Fresh, Clean</i> -- bright, colorful, and simple. Feels inviting and personal through the use of font and language ('nice' 'enjoy').</td>

<td>The portfolio is display as individual thumbnails which open new windows when clicked. Though perfectly funcional, the task of opening and closing windows becomes tedious. In addition, little information is given on what will pop up from each thumbnail.</td>

<td>Aside from pop-up windows from clicking the links in the portfolio, there is no notable interactivity on this site.</td>

<td>Relatively small navigation bar along top of the site. Can easily be overlooked, especially for those with banner-blindness. But this problem may be small, as  the front page contains a short introduction, selected portfolio works, and a contact button, eliminating a real need to navigate elsewhere on the site.</td>
</tr>

<td>6. Matt Hall
<br>(<a href="http://matt-hall.co.uk" target="new">matt-hall.co.uk</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/18/12</td>

<td><i>Bold, Minimalistic, Friendly, Professional</i> -- the monochromatic color scheme and clean lines give the site a minimalistic design, while the big headlining text is friendly, but straight-forward about what this designer does. His picture at the very bottom shows him with his baby.</td>

<td>Headliner-and-gallery portfolio with three boxes along the bottom of the page containing information on the designer, twitter updates, and links for contact. The email link should be a little easier to find, as it's hidden under the "FOLLOW ALONG" section at the bottom.</td>

<td>Interactivity is low on this site. Clicking portfolio links loads a separate page with a few extra screenshots from each project. Navigate the portfolio using a "Previous" and "Next" button on the top right.</td>

<td>With so few pages (aside from individual portfolio works), it's hard to get lost on such a small site. Huge headers on each page tell you what you're currently looking at. The navigation for the portfolio could be improved so that it doesn't lead you to separate individual pages.</td>
</tr>


<td>7. Perles de Vie
<br>(<a href="http://www.perlesdeviephoto.com" target="new">perlesdeviephoto.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/18/12</td>

<td><i>Elegant, Professional, Heart-warming, Timeless</i> -- the site has an overall clean and elegant nature, shuffling bright images from weddings and family events on the front page when you enter. The logo has a baroque-like style, and the photos encapture timeless moments.</td>

<td>Site includes mission statement, galleries, contact, and a blog - perfectly sufficient for a photography company. Functional and attractive, the gallery looks pleasant and organized. One flaw I would change is the speed at which the photos shuffle. At the speed at which they shuffle, it is hard to create a relaxed atmosphere as wedding planners browse the site.</td>

<td>The gallery page is separated into four gallery (by event), which are shown as thin vertical stripes which expand when hovered over. Navigation and gallery thumbnails light-up when you hover over them. Small interactive elements, but offers some movement on a relatively simple site.</td>

<td>Navigation along the bottom of the image follows the Featured Photo layout discussed in class. Lighting up of the text on hover-over gives a more dynamic feel. Navigational links stay lit when on that particular page, so it is unlikely to lose track of where you are on the site.</td>
</tr>


<td>8. Loewy Design
<br>(<a href="http://loewydesign.com" target="new">loewydesign.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/18/12</td>

<td><i>Professional, Innovative, Dedicated</i> -- upon entering the site, messages shuffle talking about how they're the perfect team for YOU. The site layout is unique, but remains clean and sophisticated.</td>

<td>Company and team information, portfolio of their projects, and a button for contact - the site is efficient and organized. Scrolling over works in the portfolio, animated rollovers of informational text replace the thumbnail images, providing a good preview of what it is before you click.</td>

<td>Site layout and navigation features expanding cubes. Scroll-overs mentioned previously on the portfolio page are fun and animated. Overall site has subtle, but interesting animations that bring the page to life. Works in portfolio can be sorted through filters.</td>

<td>Navigation is easy to follow. Bolded squares remind you of your current location. If you get lost, the company logo is always there to bring you back to the front page.</td>
</tr>


<td>9. Pietari Posti
<br>(<a href="http://pposti.com" target="new">pposti.com</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/19/12</td>

<td><i>Clean, Creative, Organized, Professional</i> -- The layout consists of white and grays, providing a blank canvas to feature the colorful and clean portfolio works. Everything is organized by type of work, and remains professional despite some of the whimsical pieces displayed.</td>

<td>The categories separating the portfolio pieces make browsing less confusing, but the lack of description or information until you click the actual thumbnails make for some unnecessary guesswork. Also includes an about section, blog, contact info, and an online shop.</td>

<td>Allows filtering of portfolio, and thumbnails lighten/fade on hover. Navigational text along the top and left-side of the site highlight black on scroll-over.</td>

<td>It is hard to lose your way on a site with five pages, but the logo is visible on every page (which you can use to return to the front). Titles and content on each page remind you of where you are.</td>
</tr>


<td>10. Hybrid Works
<br>(<a href="http://hybridworks.jp" target="new">hybridworks.jp</a>)
<br>Accessed on 01/19/12</td>

<td><i>Technical, Creative, Artistic</i> -- attention to detail in pixel artwork, subtle clicking sounds on scroll-over in the navigation bars. The adjustable layout and handmade graphics show off the studio's creative nature.</td>

<td>Refreshing the page changes the banner image, showing off more artwork. Links lead to an information page, contact page, shop, and twitter. Clicking the links in the works box will replace the banner with content relating to the project selected. Site is functional and interesting.</td>

<td>The site is built to be interactive. Users can control how the layout is set up. Things are animated and there is movement when you want there to be. The very work of the artist is made to be interactive (animated christmas wishes, virtual vacations, etc). The portfolio can be filtered by the type of work with buttons along the bottom of the box.</td>

<td>Navigation feels like the only downside, although it's not too terrible. The only navigational bar outside of the portfolio list is a very small box with a few text links. There is always a link to home when navigating through the portfolio (a small house icon), but even that can be easily overlooked.</td>
